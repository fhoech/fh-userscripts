Small colection of user scripts
===============================

Pop-Up Blocker
--------------
Simple but effective popup-blocker. Blocks window popups by default but allows
click-initiated popups during a 250ms grant period on secure (HTTPS) sites.
All other popups will result in a small notification bar at the top of the page,
where you can click a link to open the popup if desired.

Resizeable Text Fields
----------------------
Allows resizing of text areas, input fields, preformatted text, select boxes
and TinyMCE editor area. Originally hosted on (defunct) userscripts.org
